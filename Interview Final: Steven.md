<h3 id="introduction-and-personal-update"><strong>Introduction and Personal Update</strong></h3>
<p>Good afternoon, friends. Stephen Benun here with Israeli News Live. It’s been a while since we had Brother Greg on with us. As many of you know, his wife had passed away since that time. Brother Greg, it’s good to have you back on. How are you doing now after this time has passed since the passing of your wife?</p>
<p>Brother Greg: Well, thanks for having me on. I’m doing really, really good. My mom says I’m doing 10 times better than she thought.<br>
Stephen: Amen.<br>
Brother Greg: My life’s in heaven, so I have nothing to worry about.<br>
Stephen: A hundred percent, brother, I’m right there with you on that. You knew her a little bit, yes? You even prayed with her when she was in the hospital.<br>
Brother Greg: Yes, she had amazing faith. The first time I prayed for her, she recovered very well. But then, as you said, the sickness she had was likely there for a long time, and we just didn’t know it. Her body was eaten up with cancer from her brain to her toes, every organ in her body shut down. It was a painful, terrible thing for us, but she’s home now, and happy.<br>
Stephen: Amen, brother. Yes, she’s in a better place.</p>
<h3 id="strange-creatures-and-biblical-prophecies"><strong>Strange Creatures and Biblical Prophecies</strong></h3>
<p>Speaking of this world, there’s a lot going on. I know we’ve talked about many things, Brother Greg, but you sent me a message about creatures coming up from inside the earth. I can’t help but think of the biblical passage where it says fearful sights will come upon the earth, and men’s hearts will fail for fear.</p>
<p>Stephen: A contact in Washington told me years ago, “Steve, people have no idea the types of creatures inside this earth. The problem is, they’re not going to stay contained forever.” Even the intelligence community thinks of that verse about men’s hearts failing for fear of what’s coming upon the earth. Dinosaurs wouldn’t cause a man’s heart to fail, but what’s inside the earth is much worse.<br>
Brother Greg: I’ve seen them with my own eyes and had to deal with them. Now, I only see an outline of them sometimes. But I’m fighting the same battle as I did when I was under there with them. I’m worn out, and I need people praying for me. The things down there, the Nephilim, are just the beginning. There are every sort of evil imaginable coming up, and they’re fearsome to look at.</p>
<h3 id="modern-sightings-and-merging-dimensions"><strong>Modern Sightings and Merging Dimensions</strong></h3>
<p>Brother Greg: There have been a lot of sightings of the Rake, which was once an alien entity but looks different now. Almost every day, I see reports of creatures with giant claws and teeth. Recently in Paris, there was an incident with these entities inside a shopping mall.<br>
Stephen: I’ve seen reports of similar sightings, like the one in Miami. My contact in Washington told me that we’re entering a time where dimensions will merge. This will cause sightings of creatures from other dimensions. He said there are parallel universes to ours, and as the dimensions merge, the walls become so thin that anything—from prehistoric creatures to aliens—could appear in your bedroom.</p>
<p>In the Nag Hammadi writings, there’s a passage that speaks of dimensions collapsing at the end of times, leading to fearful sights as a result. We can’t even imagine what we’re about to see.<br>
Brother Greg: I agree. Back when I was in those places, even though it was controlled, it was as close to hell as I ever want to get. They’re murderers, all of them, and their only goal is to take as many people down with them as they can.</p>
<h3 id="cern-and-interdimensional-experiments"><strong>CERN and Interdimensional Experiments</strong></h3>
<p>Stephen: Brother Greg, I know you’ve had experience with CERN. What can you tell us about it?<br>
Brother Greg: CERN is an evil place. They’re using quantum computers from Berkeley, which are enormous and expensive. Their real goal isn’t particles; it’s opening another dimension. They’ve been successful in doing that. I heard from someone who worked there that once, when they opened a door to another dimension, a third of the crew committed suicide within minutes.</p>
<p>Stephen: There was also an incident where they opened a dimension and a creature came through, killing two scientists before they could close the dimension again.<br>
Brother Greg: Yes, you have to close the dimension after letting them through, or else they can wreak havoc. CERN is trying to access other dimensions, and they’ve been successful, even when I was there.</p>
<h3 id="dulce-base-and-the-horrors-within"><strong>Dulce Base and the Horrors Within</strong></h3>
<p>Stephen: You’ve been down in Dulce, Greg. Can you share a little about what you experienced there? I’ve heard about the horrors on level seven, but I’ve never been down inside Dulce myself. When I visited that part of New Mexico, I saw five different flying saucers in one place. I was told there’s a lot of traffic because of what goes on at Dulce.</p>
<p>Brother Greg: Level seven is total chaos, 24/7. The scientists there don’t know how to contain it. It was as close to hell as I ever want to get. The Illuminati even does ceremonies there, where they shapeshift and eat children. It’s disgusting, but I’ve seen it with my own eyes.</p>
<p>Stephen: That’s what led me to reach out to you in the first place. A colleague in D.C. told me about the horrendous experiments done on people at Dulce. He mentioned that Pegasus, the half-horse, half-human creature, is real, along with mermaids and other hybrid beings. He said they’ve taken people and reattached their bodies in unimaginable ways. Homeless people are often captured and used for these experiments. Scientists work with reptilians who have devices to know everything you say or do once you leave.</p>
<p>Brother Greg: The reptilians are in total control right now of governments. They’re responsible for wars, like the Israeli-Hamas conflict. And they walk among us without people realizing it.</p>
<h3 id="animals-in-human-form-and-ancient-writings"><strong>Animals in Human Form and Ancient Writings</strong></h3>
<p>Stephen: I discovered something interesting in the Nag Hammadi writings. There’s a quotation from Jesus that says, “There are many animals in human form.” It blew me away, but it makes sense. Jesus called the Pharisees “serpents” and “vipers,” which could mean they were animals in human form.<br>
Brother Greg: That’s right. Reptilians are real, and the things we hear about, like half-man, half-horse beings, are not fake. The Nephilim would laugh at us today for even questioning their existence.<br>
Stephen: Paul even warned us when he said, “We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities.” The word principalities there refers to archons, which are these demons in another dimension. With everything happening on earth today, the merging dimensions, and the weakening magnetosphere, we’re entering a time where these beings will become more visible.</p>
<p>The magnetosphere is about to come down, and when it does, it will have significant implications. I’ve heard this from Washington long before Mike began discussing it. Mike is incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable, with a scientific background that allows him to articulate things that we’ve known for years. Finally, he’s been given permission to bring these things out, and he’s saying things that I’ve been telling people for years.</p>
<h3 id="personal-experiences-and-skepticism">Personal Experiences and Skepticism</h3>
<p>For the last 20 years, I’ve been sharing this information on various platforms, often being labeled a lunatic. The family turned against me, and everyone else did too. But when I first heard Brother Greg, I knew that everything he spoke about was true. I even told my wife that practically everything he says is what I’ve known, although Greg knows it firsthand. The information I receive comes from a friend in Washington, who has seen things that most people wouldn’t believe.</p>
<h3 id="encounter-descriptions">Encounter Descriptions</h3>
<p>My friend described a reptilian he once saw. He said it looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime, but with a lizard-like head. These beings can be as tall as 9 to 15 feet and have a tail. The smell they emit is horrendous, like swamp gas. When we were around reptilians, some smelled worse than others, and I believe that many animals have been manipulated down there. I heard a story about a guy flying over Delcy in a Piper Cub and seeing the ground unzip like a zipper to release toxic gas. The deeper you go into the earth, the more toxic it gets, with radon being a major issue.</p>
<h3 id="health-challenges">Health Challenges</h3>
<p>I’m facing many health problems because of these experiences, but with Yeshua’s help, I’m managing. Recently, both Brother Greg and I came down with pneumonia, likely due to the spiritual and physical battles we’ve been fighting. I’ve had pneumonia three times, and I called my doctor today. He advised me that I can’t fight everything on my own. It’s crucial for people to pray for us because the challenges are becoming unmanageable.</p>
<h3 id="spiritual-battles-and-divine-revelation">Spiritual Battles and Divine Revelation</h3>
<p>Brother Greg, I understand your struggles. Whenever God reveals something significant that needs to be shared, the attacks increase. I didn’t even know I had pneumonia until today. Yesterday, I was still pushing through, and now I’m running a low-grade fever, feeling cold in a 72-degree house. These are the kinds of battles we face when bringing out the truth. People need to know what is really out there because we are running out of time. These are biblical events unfolding right before our eyes, and people need to know how to handle them.</p>
<h3 id="disclosure-and-government-involvement">Disclosure and Government Involvement</h3>
<p>I’ve said things before that were still classified, but the government has since declassified them. People often wonder how I can talk about these things after working with the CIA. There’s a law that after 30 years, you can discuss what you know. My old boss once told me that we could disappear at any moment, but they don’t kill us because it would validate everything. Instead, they warn us to stay off certain subjects.</p>
<h3 id="warnings-and-censorship">Warnings and Censorship</h3>
<p>I’ve received warnings twice since the first time I spoke with Brother Greg. When they tell you to avoid a subject, you find another way to say it. For example, I was warned not to discuss skull-to-brain technology, which is old but still sensitive. My colleague told me to keep quiet about it because it could get me killed. But they don’t want martyrs, so they allow us to speak as long as we don’t push the envelope too far.</p>
<h3 id="family-history-and-military-service">Family History and Military Service</h3>
<p>My family, like Brother Greg’s, has a history of military service. My father served three tours in Vietnam, and my grandfathers were in World War II. One of my grandfathers was in Pearl Harbor during the Japanese attack, with bullets coming through the roof of his car, but miraculously, no one was hurt. My other grandfather served under Patton in the European theater. We’ve been warriors in every generation, and that fighting spirit runs deep in our family.</p>
<h3 id="the-nature-of-disclosure">The Nature of Disclosure</h3>
<p>I know many people in the field, including Stephen Greer, and while I don’t bring them into public discussions, I believe that the powers that be want us to disclose this information. They let us say it so that they don’t have to, and they can dismiss us as crazy. However, the real disclosure will come from the entities themselves, not from us.</p>
<h3 id="government-operations-and-alien-involvement">Government Operations and Alien Involvement</h3>
<p>When the government first started disclosing information, they only revealed what they had reverse-engineered, not genuine UFOs. Mike, who contacted me, said that the aliens want the information disclosed because they plan to coexist with humanity by 2026. This is part of a great delusion, a deception that will make people believe these beings are divine.</p>
<h3 id="spiritual-warnings-and-prophetic-insights">Spiritual Warnings and Prophetic Insights</h3>
<p>Jesus warned us about this deception. When they say He’s in the desert or the secret chamber, don’t believe it. The secret chamber refers to underground bases, and the desert is connected to Project Blue Beam, which can open portals in the sky. Every underground base has a number, like Area 51, which implies there are 50 other areas before it. These bases are in every state, with Area 52 located just south of Salt Lake City.</p>
<h3 id="the-staging-area-mystery"><strong>The Staging Area Mystery</strong></h3>
<p>During a conversation, I once asked someone about the meaning of the letter “S” in a particular context. The response was that it stood for “staging area.” When I inquired further about what exactly was being staged, the reply was a casual “beats me.” However, I believe that these staging areas are used for something far more significant. They are protected zones, and it’s clear that something is being hidden there. The breaking of a contract by certain entities, supposedly made during the Eisenhower administration, adds to the intrigue. The original agreement required that abducted individuals be returned safely, a promise that was evidently broken.</p>
<h3 id="missing-children-and-alien-abductions"><strong>Missing Children and Alien Abductions</strong></h3>
<p>A staggering report suggests that 100,000 children have gone missing, particularly from border areas. While many attribute this to the sex trade, a more sinister theory exists: these children may have been abducted by aliens. Their status as “illegal aliens” makes them prime targets for these abductions, possibly for gruesome experiments. With time running out for these extraterrestrial beings, there seems to be a rapid push to fulfill their dark agenda. The Bible warns that Satan knows his time is short, and it appears we are living in that very moment.</p>
<h3 id="secrets-of-antarctica-and-the-pleiadians"><strong>Secrets of Antarctica and the Pleiadians</strong></h3>
<p>There are rumors about a hydrogen collider in Switzerland, but even more classified information pertains to Antarctica. It is believed that the Pleiadians, an alien race, are present there. Despite their white appearance, which some associate with goodness, they are as malevolent as any other extraterrestrial beings. These tall, Nephilim-like entities were even responsible for influencing Hitler. Additionally, there is speculation about a collider in Antarctica that allows these entities to control interdimensional portals.</p>
<h3 id="the-resilience-of-linda-moulton-howell"><strong>The Resilience of Linda Moulton Howell</strong></h3>
<p>Linda Moulton Howell, a renowned investigative journalist, has been targeted by the government multiple times due to her relentless pursuit of truth, particularly concerning cattle mutilations linked to extraterrestrial activities. Despite attempts to mislead and even eliminate her, she remained steadfast, always finding her way back to the truth. Her thoroughness and determination earned her respect even among those who sought to deceive her. This resilience is a testament to her investigative prowess.</p>
<h3 id="potential-guests-with-insider-knowledge"><strong>Potential Guests with Insider Knowledge</strong></h3>
<p>The text mentions the possibility of bringing on board a former Defense Department employee with extensive knowledge of secret military operations, as well as a Messianic Jewish woman who has had profound spiritual experiences. The man, a retired Navy official with top clearance, has participated in secret experiments and possesses knowledge about advanced weaponry. His insights would be invaluable, especially given his strong Christian faith. The woman, touched by Jesus, also shares her experiences on social media, making her another potential guest.</p>
<h3 id="bigfoot-and-interdimensional-beings"><strong>Bigfoot and Interdimensional Beings</strong></h3>
<p>Bigfoot, often associated with the Pacific Northwest, is believed by some to be an interdimensional creature and a descendant of the Nephilim. Despite numerous attempts by the CIA to capture these beings, they have proven elusive, possibly due to their ability to move between dimensions. Some believe that these beings serve as gatekeepers and that their incredible speed and strength make them almost impossible to capture or kill. Interestingly, there’s speculation that Bigfoot could be linked to reptilian sub-bosses.</p>
<h3 id="reptilians-in-urban-subway-systems"><strong>Reptilians in Urban Subway Systems</strong></h3>
<p>Reptilians are thought to inhabit subway systems in large cities, such as New York. These malevolent beings allegedly hold rave-like parties where unsuspecting individuals are lured, only to be captured and later consumed. The reptilians’ strength allows them to move through the city undetected, making them a significant threat to urban populations. The text suggests that the influx of homeless people in cities like California might be linked to the reptilians’ preference for human meat, turning these individuals into easy prey.</p>
<h3 id="the-elites-deal-with-the-devil"><strong>The Elite’s Deal with the Devil</strong></h3>
<p>The elites, in their quest to maintain power and status, may have struck deals with these malevolent entities. Such arrangements could involve compliance with the demands of these extraterrestrial beings, essentially making a “deal with the devil.” The text emphasizes the importance of spiritual protection and the need to rise as warriors against these dark forces, highlighting the necessity of being born again and staying true to one’s faith.</p>
<h3 id="fighting-back-against-malevolent-forces"><strong>Fighting Back Against Malevolent Forces</strong></h3>
<p>The writer resolves to make it a lifelong mission to fight against these entities, ensuring that they do not invade personal spaces or disrupt lives. Living in a Christian community where neighbors support each other, the writer believes in the power of unity and spiritual strength to keep these forces at bay. The idea is to create a safe environment where these malevolent beings cannot exert their influence.</p>
<h3 id="the-ai-army-and-ongoing-battles"><strong>The AI Army and Ongoing Battles</strong></h3>
<p>The text also touches on the existence of an AI Army, with numbers exceeding a million. This is confirmed by a contact within FEMA, who reveals that individuals with inside knowledge face constant challenges and dangers. Despite the struggles, the importance of prayer and spiritual armor is emphasized as essential tools in the ongoing battle against these dark forces.</p>
<p>Here’s a rewritten version using headings and paragraphs:</p>
<h3 id="underground-structures-and-entities">Underground Structures and Entities</h3>
<p>The conversation begins with a discussion about underground bunkers in Denver and entities affecting elites. It then moves to underground pyramids and their potential exposure due to Earth changes.</p>
<p>The speaker mentions that pyramids were designed to generate energy and could potentially power vehicles without the need for conventional charging methods.</p>
<h3 id="giant-underground-cities">Giant Underground Cities</h3>
<p>The discussion shifts to giant cities beneath various locations, including Egypt, China, Australia, and America. The speaker notes that reptilians have a network allowing them to travel under the Earth’s crust between continents.</p>
<h3 id="military-plans-and-citizen-concerns">Military Plans and Citizen Concerns</h3>
