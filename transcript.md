<p>Here is the transcript broken into paragraphs and sections with headlines:</p>
<p><strong>Introduction and Prayer</strong><br>
I just want to praise you and I just want to thank you Father. I thank you for your word that your word is like a dredged sword and the word comes to penetrate deep in our hearts. And I thank you father that this word now is starting to have to come and cut deep into us because you’re not wanting those that are just hearers of the word you want those that are doers of the word.</p>
<p>And tonight we will understand that it’s so easy for us to be able to worship you with our lips. It’s so easy for us to be able to tell you how much we love you. It’s so easy for us to be able to say, Oh, Father, I will serve you. But when it gets difficult and when it gets rough, then we see exactly how we will react towards you.</p>
<p><strong>The Israelites in the Wilderness</strong><br>
And this is what we will see in terms of the Israelites in the wilderness, where we are now in this time in this book of Exodus and we are busy laying our foundation as we are studying this book of Exodus to understand that you were laying a foundation for them. The book of Exodus was a foundation that was being laid for your people in order to understand that they are going to come into a time of a wilderness and this wilderness was going to come with many trials and many tests because they were not just going to enter the promised land without having to have been tried and tested in the wilderness and because of their disobedience in the wilderness most of them only two out of the original ones that came out of Egypt entered into the promised land. Why? Because when the trials and the tests came they complained and they feared.</p>
<p><strong>Current Critical Hour</strong><br>
And they didn’t see who you are. But instead, they looked at the trial and the test and the difficulty and the lack of manner and the lack of waterna and their lack of water and there was always something and this is where we are in our lives right now and this is what you’ve been showing me how does man behave and oh my goodness we are in a world right now that’s just got at the darkest point like you have showed me. We are in a very, very critical hour. There’s never been an hour such as this where everything that can come against your word is going to come against your word in order for people to be able to compromise.</p>
<p><strong>The Purpose of Trials</strong><br>
Because that is exactly what the enemy did with Eve and with Adam in the garden. Eve was deceived. Adam disobeyed and they were kicked out of the garden and this is exactly where we are right now in our time in our process of being able to be tested and tried to be proved faithful. Because every trial and every test is to equip us for the greater work that you have for us to be able to do in the days ahead. And if we would just embrace our trial and overcome our trial and understand our trial, it would make it that much easier for us to be able to grin and be. Because we would understand that you have a purpose and a plan in what you are doing.</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude and Reflection</strong><br>
And so, my Father, I just want to thank you, Father, for this time, for this very, very critical hour that we find ourselves in and that which you are revealing to me in what is unfolding and what I see before my very eyes. As I stand before your people. And I see where they are. And it’s heart-wrenching. And it’s heart-breaking. But we’re all going to have to write our tests to overcome.</p>
<p><strong>Overcoming and God’s Consuming Fire</strong><br>
Now we’re either going to give in to the flesh and allow the flesh to have its way, or we’re either going to have to overcome because who are those that are going to overcome? They overcame by the power of the blood and the word of their testament, and they did not love their lives unto death when Hasatan was thrown onto the earth we are in a critical hour Father and so I thank you for the many lessons that we are understanding in your word, that you are a consuming fire. Your word is a consuming fire. And you will consume everything out of us that’s not of us, and you will bring whatever into our lives in order to expose ourselves to ourselves to know what is really there.</p>
<p><strong>Studying Exodus Chapter 23</strong><br>
So we are really going deep and we are really zoning in on this book of this chapter 23 of Exodus and that’s why the father said don’t rush it. Don’t rush it because you’re not rushing anything. You’re not on a schedule to want to rush anything. This is not like when we’re doing Torah teachings. The Torah teachings, you’ve got so many chapters to get through. And you can’t read verse by verse and line by line and precept by precept and try and explain everything because there’s no time. You’ve got to try do it in the most amount of time as what you can in that you can’t take hours and hours to try and explain everything.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Foundations</strong><br>
But while we have been studying our book of Exodus, we are taking our time just as we took our time with the book of Genesis because father is trying to teach us these are our foundations this is our foundational covenant this is the one this is the very foundations on which we’ve got to build our house and this is what Yeshua said in Matthew chapter 7 he says unless a house is built on a solid foundation it’s not going to stand why because the storms are going to come and when the rain comes and when the wind comes then you are going to see and right now believe me when I say to you, the storms are starting to come fast and furious.</p>
<p><strong>The Month of Av</strong><br>
We have just entered into the month of Av. What is the significance of this month of Av? The significance of this month of Av is the month of Av. Av means Avvinu. It’s the month of our father. It’s the fifth month. And this fifth month is to be able to come back to sitting at the feet of our father and allow our father to be able to reveal himself. Because it’s the fifth month. The letter five. In the Hebrew language. Is the letter of the. The hay. And what is this hay? To behold. To reveal. To look upon. To behold his glory. To look upon. To behold his glory. To look upon him. That we will behold him. And it’s his breath. It’s the breath. The breath of Yahuwah. His breath. That needs to be able to be. Blown in us. Where he is wanting to be able to come and blow his breath in us, his Ruach in us. And we have to behold him and we have to look upon him and we have to behold his glory.</p>
<p><strong>The Father’s Revelation</strong><br>
And this is what he’s trying to reveal to us in this hour, that we will once again have ears to hear and eyes to see, come and sit at our father’s feet and allow him to be able to come and reveal himself to us. And reveal himself to us. And so he is opening up. The mind of our understanding. That we will understand. Our father’s hearts.</p>
<p><strong>Preparing for Elul</strong><br>
Because the month of Av. Is the month of the father. That prepares us for Alul. Which is when the kill will be in the field, which is the sixth month, which is the month of the flesh that needs to be able to come to a place of laying down. Because it’s the sixth month, which is the letter of the house that is going to be able to be the nail tent bed. But we come in the month of oath to prepare our hearts, to prepare ourselves to once again have eyes to behold our Father, that he may reveal himself to us, that he may breathe on us, that we have eyes to see and ears to hear as we will understand tonight.</p>
<p><strong>The Power of God’s Word</strong><br>
Because there’s nothing more powerful than to be able to come and have the Father speak in our inner man. Because the Father wants to open up his word to us. The Father wants to reveal himself to us. Gone is the day that we just really, really, if there’s one thing that I have understood over the last few weeks, and even as I sit with my group of my Shabbat Torah, my little group of the Torah that I teach in Afrikaans. I see how their eyes are now being opened. I see how their ears are being opened. I see now where all of a sudden things that never made sense to them, now when we’re studying the scriptures they’re having understanding and the biggest problem that we have is that people read the word but they don’t understand the word so you could have read scriptures like now they’re reading scriptures where all of a sudden they’ve been reading it all for years and years and years and years, but it never spoke to them like it’s speaking now.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 7: Hearing and Doing</strong><br>
And so in Matthew chapter 7 he turns around and says, therefore, Matthew chapter 7 verse 24, therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and does them. This is the key. This is the key to everything, beloveds. Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and does them shall be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And why he’s just said who hears the words and does them and what is just above it, not everyone who says to me master master shall enter into the reign of the heavens so not everybody that’s going to come and say but you’re sure I did all this preaching I did all these things I did all these good, but you’re sure? I did all this preaching. I did all these things. I did all these good things for you. I went and I did all this. Not everybody that says master, master. I prophesied in your name. I cast out demons in your name. Shall enter into the reign of the heavens. But he who is doing the desire of my Father in the heavens.</p>
<p><strong>Obedience as Worship</strong><br>
Now, this is what we’re going to understand tonight. It’s easy for us to be able to say, Oh Father, I will obey you. Whatever you say, I will do. Just like they did. Whatever you say, we will do. But just around the corner, we don’t do. Because we do not want to obey. Now, we’ve got to understand something. Obedience is the highest form of worship. That is what the Father said to me one morning when I had been worshipping throughout the night. I had worshipped for about five hours. Went to bed. Woke up in the morning. After I’d only had like two or so hours sleep. And then I felt so good because I’ve just done such a good work here. I felt so good. Felt so good about myself. And then I heard him say to me, my child, what is the highest form of worship? What is the highest form of worship that you could offer me? The highest form of worship that I require of you is your obedience. And you are not to forget, my son learned obedience by what he suffered. So he had to suffer in order to be able to learn the obedience. But we don’t want any suffering in our lives.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Obedience</strong><br>
So it’s more important for you to be able to be obedient to the Father than what it is. The fact that you can read your Bible for three hours. You can go to church three times a week. You can do one of that. But whatever the Father tells you to do, if you don’t do it, you are disobedient. So when you keep reading his word and you keep hearing his word and you are disobedient, you are rebellious. And the word says that rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft because to know the good that you are to do and you don’t do it that is rebellion against the father and his word and this is what I had to confront yesterday</p>
<p><strong>Personal Experiences with Forgiveness</strong><br>
I sat in front of people yesterday that I’m praying for at our soup kitchen and the father has just spoke a powerful word from Revelation chapter 3 about the church of Laodicea you’re either hot or you’re either cold but if you look warm he’s going to spit you out of his mouth. And we worked through this whole thing of forgiveness. And I had to take them through Matthew chapter 18. And they were explained, not only by me, but by Susanne, two of us explaining to them forgiveness, the bitterness in the heart and all of this and how you need to forgive or else the tormentors are going to come and torment you because the father said to me, my child, it doesn’t help you to keep praying for them, praying for them, praying for them, praying for them, but they got soul wounds and you need to help them now to heal those soul wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Helping People Heal</strong><br>
So how are you going to help them to heal that soul wounds? They are going to have to understand that they have to start taking ownership for their lives. And they’re now going to have to start dealing with the hurt and the pain that is there. And they are going to have to bring it to surface. And they’re going to have to get rid of the bitterness, the hatred, the anger, everything else that is there that they’ve got against people, against me, against everything.</p>
<p><strong>Encounters with Unsaved Individuals</strong><br>
But you know how sad it is when you’re standing in front of, I stood in front of two men that the Father showed me they’re not saved. So I said to them, have you accepted Yeshua as your Messiah? No. I said, are you ready to accept him? Not right now. I don’t want to do that right now. I’m not ready for that right now. Okay, no problem. So you see, I’m not ready for that because I still want to enjoy my life. I’m not ready for that because I still don’t want to surrender my flesh. I’m not ready for that because right now I don’t want to submit and surrender to the Father. I want to continue to be disobedient for as long as I can.</p>
<p><strong>The Urgency of the Hour</strong><br>
But you don’t understand that the clock is not even at five to midnight the clock has already gone past one minute to midnight it’s almost at midnight and the darkest hour is upon our lives is upon our doorstep is upon us because let me tell you what the father said to me the restrainer that restrains has been removed and that’s what happened at the Olympics and all the hell he’s unleashing but I’m not ready to be obedient just yet let me just enjoy my life just a little bit more because it’s not yet the end and then from there I went into a meeting with the woman that runs the welfare.</p>
<p><strong>The Present-Focused Mindset</strong><br>
And she says, I can’t believe these people. They’re like living for the day of today. Like there’s no tomorrow. And they don’t even see what’s going on around them in this world. I said, my sister, this is exactly where we are. We don’t have to commit to, why worry about the day of tomorrow? In the sense of where I don’t need to be able, let me take my drugs now, let me drink my alcohol now, let me take my, if I don’t, I’m going to take all the bit of money that I’ve got and I’m going to use it for today because I want to be able to get drunk today. And if I don’t have food tomorrow, it’s also okay.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Salvation</strong><br>
But at the end of the day, this is what the Father is saying to us. He says, not everybody that’s going to… And then these people think, just because I’ve accepted Jesus into my life, I’m saved, I’m going to heaven. But now stands in front of me one that doesn’t want to be saved. So I had to very politely say to him, I said, look, one thing that you must understand, I am obliged to tell you the truth because your blood is not going to be on my hands. So I just want you to know something. I know I don’t want to force you to do anything because that’s not the way it needs to be done. But if you walk out of that door today and just around the corner, someone is going to come and knock you over and you have to die. Where are you going to go? I want you to go away and think about that. Where are you going? Because I want you to understand there’s only two places. There’s only heaven or hell. It’s one of the two. And you can’t be in between because there is no in between place.</p>
<p><strong>The Decision of Surrender</strong><br>
So I need you to go away and to think about that, ponder on that, let you understand that is your life, is your not wanting to surrender your life right now to him so not important that your eternal life that is for eternity which is forever and ever and ever so for this little bit of time that you got on this earth you’re not willing to surrender and this is where we make our decisions we’re so busy trying to gratify the lust of our flesh on this earth, and this earth is about to fade and be destroyed. And it’s for such a short period of time right now.</p>
<p><strong>The Coming Darkness</strong><br>
And then we are about to face the darkest hour that has yet come upon the earth. But we will have missed, we will have missed being protected by the Father because we didn’t want to submit we wanted to gratify our flesh so he says many shall come to me in that day master master have we not prophesied in your name cost our demons in your name done many mighty works in your name and then i shall declare to them i never knew you depart from me, you who work lawlessness.</p>
<p><strong>Building on the Rock</strong><br>
Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and does them shall be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain came down, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on the house, and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock. So it’s easy for us to say, but your Shui is our rock. And as long as I’m in him, how do you be in him if you do not keep his word? Because he is the word. So if you say you are in him, then you need to abide by his word.</p>
