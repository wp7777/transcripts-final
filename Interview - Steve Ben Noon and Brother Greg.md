<h3 id="introduction-pt-1-welcoming-brother-greg"><strong>Introduction Pt 1: Welcoming Brother Greg</strong></h3>
<p>Good afternoon, friends. Stephen Benun here with Israeli News Live, and it’s been a while since we had Brother Greg on with us. Since that time, as many of you know, his wife had passed away. Brother Greg, it’s good to have you back on. How are you doing now after this time has passed since her passing?</p>
<p>Greg: Thanks for having me on. I’m doing really, really good. My mom says I’m doing 10 times better than she thought.</p>
<p>Stephen: Amen, brother. I’m right there with you on that. I remember praying for her when she was in the hospital. She had amazing faith, didn’t she?</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="reflections-on-faith-and-loss"><strong>Reflections on Faith and Loss</strong></h3>
<p>Greg: Yes, she did. Her body was eaten up with cancer from her brain to her toes. Every organ in her body shut down. It was a terrible, painful thing for us to witness, but she’s home now, and that gives me peace.</p>
<p>Stephen: Amen. It’s comforting to know she’s in a better place, especially considering the pain she was in. Speaking of this world, there’s so much going on that we need to discuss.</p>

<h3 id="biblical-and-prophetic-discussions-creatures-from-the-earth"><strong>Biblical and Prophetic Discussions: Creatures from the Earth</strong></h3>
<p>Stephen: Brother Greg, you mentioned something in a message about creatures coming up from inside the earth. It reminded me of the biblical passage about fearful sights and the things coming upon the earth that will cause men’s hearts to fail for fear.</p>
<p>Greg: Yes, I’ve seen these creatures with my own eyes and had to deal with them. It’s a battle I’m still fighting. The Nephilim and other unimaginable evil things are coming up, and they are fearsome to look at.</p>
<p>Stephen: It’s frightening to think about. My contact in Washington warned me that people have no idea about the creatures inside this earth and that they won’t stay contained forever. Even in the intelligence community, there are concerns about what’s coming.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="encounters-with-entities-and-dimensional-merging"><strong>Encounters with Entities and Dimensional Merging</strong></h3>
<p>Greg: Every day, I hear about more sightings of creatures. The Rake, which was once an alien entity, now looks different. There have been incidents where these entities, sometimes described as translucent beings, are seen in public places like shopping malls.</p>
<p>Stephen: That’s alarming. My contact mentioned that we’re entering a time where dimensions will merge, causing sightings of creatures from other dimensions. This concept even appears in ancient writings, which predict that dimensions will collapse upon one another, leading to fearful sights.</p>

<h3 id="the-role-of-cern-in-dimensional-experiments"><strong>The Role of CERN in Dimensional Experiments</strong></h3>
<p>Stephen: Speaking of dimensions, there’s been a lot of discussion about CERN and its role in opening up other dimensions. CERN denies that their purpose is interdimensional, but many believe otherwise. What do you know about CERN from your past experiences?</p>
<p>Greg: CERN is indeed involved in trying to access other dimensions, and they’ve been successful. I know they use enormous quantum computers and that their experiments have had terrifying consequences, like when they accidentally opened a dimension, and a creature killed two scientists.</p>
<p>Stephen: It’s chilling to think about. I’ve heard similar stories, including one where a large portion of the CERN crew committed suicide after an experiment went wrong. The technology they are playing with is extremely dangerous.</p>

<h3 id="experiences-at-dulce-base-a-glimpse-into-hell"><strong>Experiences at Dulce Base: A Glimpse into Hell</strong></h3>
<p>Stephen: I know you’ve been down in Dulce. For those who haven’t heard, can you share some of your experiences there? I’ve heard that Level 7, also known as Minus Seven, is beyond horrific.</p>
<p>Greg: Level 7 at Dulce is total chaos. It’s as close to hell as I ever want to get. The things I’ve seen there are unspeakable, including the Illuminati conducting ceremonies where they shapeshift and eat children. It’s real, and I’ve seen it with my own eyes.</p>
<p>Stephen: That’s horrifying. I’ve heard from sources that the experiments conducted at Dulce are beyond belief, including the creation of creatures like Pegasus and mermaids through genetic manipulation. They even splice humans with animals.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="reptilians-and-government-control"><strong>Reptilians and Government Control</strong></h3>
<p>Greg: The reptilians are in total control of the governments right now. They’re responsible for many of the world’s conflicts, including the recent war in Israel. These beings walk among us, and most people wouldn’t even recognize them.</p>
<p>Stephen: It’s hard to comprehend, but I recently found an ancient Egyptian writing where Jesus himself spoke of “animals in human form.” He referred to the Pharisees as serpents and vipers, which could indicate they were not fully human.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-reality-of-ancient-creatures-and-dna-manipulation"><strong>The Reality of Ancient Creatures and DNA Manipulation</strong></h3>
<p>Greg: Yes, those ancient creatures and beings are real. The Nephilim and other hybrid creatures have existed for thousands of years, and they’re still around today. People from those times would laugh at us for questioning their existence.</p>
<p>Stephen: That’s so true. The ancient texts and even the disciples were aware of these entities. Paul warned us that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities, which are these demonic beings from other dimensions.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="conclusion-pt-1-the-battle-ahead"><strong>Conclusion Pt 1: The Battle Ahead</strong></h3>
<p>Greg: The battle we’re facing now is intense, and the reptilians are in total control. They know everything about us, and they’re not afraid to use that knowledge against us.</p>
<p>Stephen: That’s why we need to stay vigilant and keep our faith strong. The times we’re living in are unprecedented, and the challenges ahead will be great. Let’s keep each other in prayer and prepare for what’s to come.</p>
